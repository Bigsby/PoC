    Money in software development is in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Good requirements</li>
    <li>Good implementations</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The choice of the programming language is close to irrelevant to fulfill a set of requirements with a good implementation,
    i.e., algorithm. A particular language, most importantly, the runtime where the code will, eventually, run in and its
    included libraries, might help one get there faster or in a "nicer" way, one might have preferences regarding syntax,
    paradigma, etc., but all that has little impact on end value. There is, virtually, nothing only one language "does" or
    one language "doesn't".
</p>
<p>
    Having that in mind, here goes an exploration of the basics, similarities and differences of some of the most used programming
    languages. Simple to complex examples implemented parallelly on each language to outline its implementation of the intended
    funcitonalilty. It might also serve as a quick cheatsheet.

    <p class="title">Notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No libraries other than the ones included in the runtime or the operating system are used.</li>
        <li>As a consequence of the previous point, the implementations are not necessarily the common practise.</li>
        <li>Although most of the code here runs cross-platform, this is, until further notice, only tested on Windows (10).</li>
        <li>At least, an attempt is made to use the latest version of each language/runtime. The version used indicated in the list below.</li>
        <li>The IDE used to code everything here (inlcuding this website) is <a target="_blank" href="http://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>            for its code highlighting.</li>
